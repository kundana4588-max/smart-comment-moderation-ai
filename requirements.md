# AI-Powered Smart Comment Moderation System

## 1. Problem Statement
Social media platforms face increasing issues of hate speech, harassment, threats, and abusive language. Current moderation systems are mostly punitive and reactive. There is a need for a preventive moderation system that stops harmful comments before they are posted while encouraging healthy communication.

## 2. Objective
To design an AI-based real-time comment moderation system that:
- Supports multilingual and mixed-language text (English, Hinglish, Tinglish).
- Detects hate speech, harassment, threats, bullying, intimidating tone and abusive intent.
- Encourages users to edit harmful comments instead of directly blocking them.

## 3. Requirements

### --> Comment Analysis
- The system shall analyze comments in real time.
- The system shall detect:
  - Hate speech
  - Harassment or bullying
  - Threatening or intimidating tone
  - Abusive intent even without explicit bad words

### --> User Interface
- Instagram-style comment input box.
- Two buttons:
  - Analyze Comment
  - Post Comment (enabled only after safe analysis)

### --> Multilingual Support
- Support Hinglish and Tinglish mixed language.
- Handle slang, informal spelling, and phonetic typing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Low latency for real-time processing.
- High accuracy in toxicity detection.
- Scalable for large social media platforms.
- Privacy-preserving and secure.

## 5. Stakeholders
- Social media users
- Platform administrators
- Developers and moderators
- Society and online communities

## 6. Success Criteria
